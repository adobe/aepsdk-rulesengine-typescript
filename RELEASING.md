# Releasing AEP Rules Engine

We are using github action to run the workflow to publish a new semantic version to NPM.
The **[npm-publish yml file](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-rulesengine-typescript/blob/main/.github/workflows/npm-publish.yml)** uses standard npm-publish.
The workflow is triggered manually by clicking on Run workflow button on github UI.

## Steps:
1. Change the version number in [package.json](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-rulesengine-typescript/blob/main/package.json) file following semantic versioning.
2. Commit the changes to main branch.
3. Add a Git tag with the new release version number. To do so click on [**releases**](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-rulesengine-typescript/releases), draft a new release.
You see option to find or create a new tag here. Create a new one.
Add release title as your version number and click on publish release button.
You don't need autogenerated release notes. No need to upload any binary files as it will be auto-populated once you click on publish release.
